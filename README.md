I bought a XIAOMI Mijia 160Â° dash cam for my car, but soon it became clear that there is an issue.
The camera should start recording once car starts supplying USB power,
but sometimes (perhaps ~10% chance) the camera would fail to do so.
I've also failed to reproduce this indoors (it could be temperature dependent),
so warranty repair was unlikely to help. So I decided to solve this problem myself.

Specifically, two factors made this tractable:
* An LED indicates whether the device is recording (white) or not (red)
* A failure to record can be solved with a simple restart (cut the power for a few seconds)

The LED is read using a covered photoresistor with a blue light filter and an analog to digital converter (built into Arduino).
The power is handled with a transistor+relay.

The final electrical scheme was complicated by two main factors:
* The 5V USB supply became 4.5V when the camera was on, which rendered the Arduino unstable.
Thus, Arduino power had to be regulated.
* Arduino power has to be swappable. While debugging, it's connected and powered using the computer's USB.
While working in the car, it's powered by the same 5V that goes to the camera. These two power sources
must not be connected, otherwise I risk damaging my computer. As a result I had to cut and solder a few USB cables.
